# Design-Patterns-Tutorial-Facade
Facade design pattern is used to create simplified interfaces that abstract from the user, performing hidden actions. Example: "Can I withdraw $50 from my account?" The interface checks if the bank account is valid, if the security code is valid, if funds are available, and responds, making changes accordingly if answer is yes.
